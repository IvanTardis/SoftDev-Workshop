DISCO:
* we could have used inline styling to supplement the fef html/css
* be careful what you link
* #s in ref links allow you to link to "sections" of your page
* Foundation setup, make sure to include:
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/foundation-sites/dist/css/foundation.min.css">
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/foundation-sites/dist/js/foundation.min.js"></script>
  <script>
    $(document).foundation();
  </script>
* foundation had prebuilt templates available for download
* for foundation, we didn't notice another script statement at the bottom of the file,
  that caused a lot of headache and unpleasantries

Q1:
I think I prefer bootstrap, I can't define it exactly, but it seems a lot more intuitive and easier to work with. The other frameworks, though good, seemed a bit more finicky. Maybe this is a preference that will change with time as I work with one or the other, but as of right now, I just generally prefer bootstrap.
