# New York Times APIs

## Provides:
This API provides devos who wish to read and educate themselves access to New York Times APIs, with many broad databases of information, for example:

- **NYT Article Search**: An API to search and find specific articles based on keywords.
- **Most Popular**: An API to find the most popular articles based on given metrics.
- **Top Stories**: An API to the top stories of the NYT in a given section(cooking, sports, home page, etc).
- **AND SO MUCH MORE**

### Pain factor: 1
(0=ezpz...5=nightmare)

The NYT developer website is fairly straightforward, and even has a "get started" link for a tab with instructions on how to set up different API keys, and good organization. The documentation for each API is clean as well, with details on how to adjust the url for select results.

### Key Provisioning:     

- Definitely make sure to click the get started link in the top-right of the home page, because it will give a generally comprehensive set of instructions that will help will most of the steps here.
- Sign-up for an account with your Name, email, password.
- Confirm the account from an email sent to you.
- Explore the APIs page for all the ones you may want to use.
- Click on your user profile in the top-right, and go to Apps. In Apps, you can create a new app, with an adequate description and title for storage.
 - I suggest to make one where you enable it with access for all APIS, just so you don't have too many to manage.
