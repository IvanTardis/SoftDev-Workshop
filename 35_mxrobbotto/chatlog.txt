Web log hosting site project structure and implementation
Scenario Two: Your team has been contracted to create a web log hosting site, with the following features:

    Users will have to register to use the site.
    A logged-in user will be able to
        Create a new blog
        Update their blog by adding a new entry
        View and edit their own past entries
        View the blogs of other users

Your "software solution," to use the parlance of our times, will incorporate a few distinct components, so it is imperative that your team develop a design before taking any further steps.

Project Guidelines:

    Flask will serve as your web server/delivery framework.
    SQLite3 will serve as your backend data storage system.
        As you grown your "sql-fu", always start with Devo Knowledge Base (QAF, n&c) and primary documentation. (...and if none of these have the answer you seek, and you find a SO post that is actually useful, or any other diamond in the rough of the Intertrash, add it to Devo KB)
        Get creative, think boldly, get your hands dirty as you experiment via the sqlite3 shell and see what works/sticks...
    Multiple Python files should be used, as necessary, for application layer. (a.k.a. "middleware" modules, etc.)

    Reminder: include heading as comment in all source files.
    Platinum Rule: THOUST APP SHALT NOT FAIL.

Your website will incorporate a few distinct components, so it is imperative that your team develop a design and agree upon roles before you move to implementation.

FINAL DELIVERABLES (watch this section for updates):

    hardcopy:
        final version of design doc (x1)
        staple because it indicates "you have it together"
    repo structure:

app/
    __init__.py
    templates/
README.md
requirements.txt

    requirements.txt
        It will list flask as well as any other pip installs your app requires.
        Latest version of all packages

Here is a proposed project structure and initial files for your web log hosting site using Flask and SQLite3.

This provides a basic structure and initial implementation. You can expand upon this by adding more features, improving the UI, and securing the application further.
For the requirements.txt file, please use this as a reference so I can run my virtual environment on it to install necesssary packages:
blinker==1.8.2
click==8.1.7
Flask==3.0.3
itsdangerous==2.2.0
Jinja2==3.1.4
MarkupSafe==2.1.5
Werkzeug==3.0.4

Sure, here is the requirements.txt file with the specified packages:
name=requirements.txt

blinker==1.8.2
click==8.1.7
Flask==3.0.3
itsdangerous==2.2.0
Jinja2==3.1.4
MarkupSafe==2.1.5
Werkzeug==3.0.4
Flask-SQLAlchemy
Flask-Login

This file includes the additional necessary packages for database handling and user authentication with Flask.
This is the error I got when I ran your code:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/students/odd/2025/igontchar50/Documents/SoftDev/SoftDev-Workshop/35_mxrobbotto/__init__.py", line 10, in <module>

    app.config.from_object(Config)
NameError: name 'app' is not defined

The error is occurring because the config.py file is trying to use app.config.from_object(Config) which should be done in the __init__.py file of the app directory, not in the config.py file itself.

Here is the corrected config.py file and the __init__.py file:
config.py
1 vulnerability detected

app/__init__.py

Now, the config.py file defines the Config class without attempting to use app.config, and the __init__.py file applies the configuration to the Flask app instance. This should resolve the NameError.

The error is occurring because the config.py file is trying to use app.config.from_object(Config) which should be done in the __init__.py file of the app directory, not in the config.py file itself. Here is the corrected config.py file and the __init__.py file: config.py config.py v2 """ Configuration settings for the Flask application. """ import os 1 vulnerability detected app/__init__.py app/__init__.py v2 """ Initialization of Flask app and configuration.
